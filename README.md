## Project Overview

This Task Manager app allows users to add and manage their daily tasks in a simple interface.  
Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design and built with React for fast, interactive UI updates.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a simple input field  
- Delete tasks by clicking the remove button  
- Keyboard support: press **Enter** to add tasks  
- Responsive layout works well on desktop and mobile  
- Minimal and user-friendly design

## How It Works

- The app maintains a list of tasks in React state.  
- Users enter a task into the input field.  
- Pressing the **Add** button or hitting **Enter** adds the task to the list.  
- Each task is displayed with a delete (`×`) button next to it.  
- Clicking the delete button removes that task from the list.  
- The UI updates instantly on state changes, thanks to React’s reactivity.
